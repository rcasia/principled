# Architecture Decision Records

Significant technical decisions for this project, newest last.

An ADR is written **in the same commit as the change it justifies**. If a
commit changes how the system is built, its ADR ships with it.

## Writing a new ADR

1. Copy [`template.md`](template.md) to `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`.
2. Fill it in. Be honest about the cons; an ADR with no downsides is an advert.
3. Add a row to the index above.
4. Commit it together with the change it describes.

## Status values

- **Proposed** — under discussion, not yet acted on.
- **Accepted** — decided and being implemented.
- **Deprecated** — no longer relevant, not replaced.
- **Superseded** — replaced by a later ADR, which must be linked.

Accepted ADRs are not edited to change a decision. Write a new ADR that
supersedes the old one, so the history of reasoning stays intact.
